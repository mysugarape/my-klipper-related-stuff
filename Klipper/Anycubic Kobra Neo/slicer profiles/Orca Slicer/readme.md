that are my profiles for Orca Slicer, get really good results with it, so i like to share it with u !


Slicer settings mostly adopted from my prusa-slicer profile, with some tweaks for my needs, but should work like a charm.

PLA Profile:
- i print mostly Sunlu PLA, and thats one of my favourite filaments
- Extruder: 200
- Bed: 60
- Start Code for Basic Orca Fuctions

As always, test it and tweak it for ur needs, and use it on ur own risk.

If this profiles work for u let me know, or u tweak some more things which working great, let us know too.

HAPPY PRINTING
