<h1>Printbead Upgrades (15min)</h1>

<h3>Springs for Heatbed, better calibration</h3>
Add Springs to Heatbed, you need a 5mm Drill to widen the 4x holes. Drill slow and carefuly, u dont need to disasamble the heatbed mount, just drill slowly and carfuly. The Screws are a little bit long, but fits. U can shorten them or not :)<br>

<h3>Heatbed isolation (10min)</h3>
for energie saving and stable heating u can add this isolation sticker. Just unscrew the bedscrews, put the printbed aside. Use a boxcutter to cut out the screw holes, the cabel connection, dont forget to cut out the endstop for the y axis :) like me. If all cut done simply remove the stickertape from the back (not completly now !) and push it to the bed (it sticks very well so make sure u have aligned it well)
