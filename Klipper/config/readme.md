<h1>Anycubic Kobra NEO</h1>

This config file is only for the Anycubic Kobra Neo, not for Kobra Neo 2!

Most if the work was done by xpeng and i tweak some settings.


<h3>Z-Offset</h3>
Calibrate ur Z-Offset before u use this config file !!! If not the Nozzle could crash into the bed !

<h3>KAMPS</h3>
I recommend to use KAMPS, its a great piece of code. For Setup and Installation visit:<br>
