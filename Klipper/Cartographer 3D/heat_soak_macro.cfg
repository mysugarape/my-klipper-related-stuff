# Cartographer Coil Heatsoaking MACRO    
# EXAMPLE GIVEN BY RICHARD VIA DISCORD TEMPERATURE_WAIT SENSOR='temperature_sensor cartographer_coil' MINIMUM=30
# 
# modified by mysugarape / 04.2024
#
# This is a heat soak macro for cartographer 3d or any other probe, which needs a specific temperature to get the best results.
# This macro was developed for my Anycubic Kobra Neo - because the Cartographer 3D Probe was not directly developed for this
# kind of maistream printer, some custom code is needed to get the full potential of the Cartographer 3D.
#
# Because temperature is important in view of the coil and mesh, i would recommend to heatsoak the coil, specialy in cold
# enviroments. To get the best mesh results, u should do a bed-mesh within the temperature which u used at the calibration
# of the cartographer. For me it was on 30 degrees. There is a 1 degree buffer to cover the time the bed-mesh starts.
#
#
# What does this macro do ?
#
# - it lowers the Z-Axis to 1mm, to get the probe as near as possible to the bed, too speed up the soaking
# - bed is heated to the given temperature
# - wait until the temperature of the cartographer 3D coil is reached
# - after coil temperature is reached, Z-Axis rises back to 10mm
# - turn-off bed
# - continuing regular print
#
# params.min_coil_temp|default(31) -> change 31 to ur defaults, or pass MIN_COIL_TEMP via start macro
#
# Stage: Quick & Dirty - some finetuning must be done in future, but it is working as expected !
#
#  Use it in START_PRINT:
#    COIL_HEAT_SOAK BED={target_bed} MIN_COIL_TEMP={min_coil_temp} # change BED to ur  Start-Macro Variable!!!
