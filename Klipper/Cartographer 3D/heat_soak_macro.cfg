# Cartographer Coil Heatsoaking MACRO    
# EXAMPLE GIVEN BY RICHARD VIA DISCORD TEMPERATURE_WAIT SENSOR='temperature_sensor cartographer_coil' MINIMUM=30
# 
# created by mysugarape / 04.2024
#
#   This is a heat soak macro for cartographer 3d or any other probe, which needs a specific temperature to get the best results.
#   This macro was developed for my Anycubic Kobra Neo - because the Cartographer 3D Probe was not directly developed for this
#   kind of maistream printer, some custom code is needed to get the full potential of the Cartographer 3D.
#
#   Because temperature is important in view of the coil and mesh, i would recommend to heatsoak the coil, specialy in cold
#   environments. To get the best mesh results, u should do a bed-mesh within the temperature which u used at the calibration
#   of the cartographer. For me it was on 30 degrees. There is a 1 degree buffer to cover the time the bed-mesh starts.
#
#   Example:
#   the coil of my cartographer probe needs 8 minutes, from 14 to 31 degrees with 55 degree bed-temperature. No chamber is used
#   and the workshop is mostly not heated so its a really rough printing environment. 
#
#
#   What does this macro do ?
#
# - it lowers the Z-Axis to 1mm, to get the probe as near as possible to the bed, too speed up the soaking
# - bed is heated to the given temperature
# - wait until the temperature of the cartographer 3D coil is reached
# - after coil temperature is reached, z-axis get back to safe_z_home height
# - turn-off bed
# - continuing with regular start_macro
#
# params.min_coil_temp|default(31) -> change 31 to ur defaults, or pass MIN_COIL_TEMP via start macro
#
# stage: quick & dirty - some finetuning must be done in future, but it is working as expected !
#
#
#   Add the example code to ur existing start-macro, make sure u place it after a G28 (Home) and before M140 (Bed heating) !
#   The printer should be homed, before the macro is executed ! Ur printer should <code>HOME</code> in the center of the buildplate,
#   if u use a cartographer or beacon probe everything should be okay, because it is the standart configuration.
#  
#   Use it in START_PRINT, Example:
# 
#    # change BED to your variable, it should be the same as in ur start
#    #
#    # use this example if u only like to pass the bed variable:
#    COIL_HEAT_SOAK BED={target_bed}
#
#    # use this example, if u like to pass a min. coil temperature value use:
#    COIL_HEAT_SOAK BED={target_bed} MIN_COIL_TEMP={min_coil_temp}
