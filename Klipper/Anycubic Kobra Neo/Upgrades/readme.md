<h1>Printbed Upgrades (15min)</h1>

<h3>Springs for Heatbed, better calibration</h3>
Add Springs to Heatbed, you need a 5mm Drill to widen the 4x holes. Drill slow and carefuly, u dont need to disasamble the heatbed mount, just drill slowly and carfuly. The Screws are a little bit long, but fits. U can shorten them or not :)<br>

<h3>Heatbed isolation (10min)</h3>
for energie saving and stable heating u can add this isolation sticker. Just unscrew the bedscrews, put the printbed aside. Use a boxcutter to cut out the screw holes, the cabel connection, dont forget to cut out the endstop for the y axis :) like me. If all cut done simply remove the stickertape from the back (not completly now !) and push it to the bed (it sticks very well so make sure u have aligned it well)

<h3>PEO/PEI TEXTURED PLATE</h3>
there are serval plates out which have cool pattern designs, u can try them all if u like. Make sure u find a Size 230x230 or 235x235, the 235x235 size fits perfect !

<h1>Mainboard</h1>
if u plan to use klipper or u use klipper already, i suggest to upgrade the board. The SKR Pico Board is perfect, there are serval adapters out which allows u to use the original mainboard slot. My Main Goal was a 2nd Zaxis, because the Stockboard is limited, the Pico brings NEOPIXEL Support which allows u to lighten up ur printer.<br><br>

- u have to crimp the ends of the mainpower cords to smaller ones, because the stock crimping is to thick to fit into the pico

- u have to cut the top of the Endstop plugs so they fit (only the notches on the top)

- rewire the Z Endstop (the stock connector is a 2 PIN, the Pico board have a 3 Pin Z Endstop, use a dupont or JST Connector if u have one) make a note from the original wiring so u dont have to mess around with pins.
